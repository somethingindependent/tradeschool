  bio: |
    Andrea is a teaching artist, sketchbook adventurer &
    advocate for creative confidence from Denver, Colorado. Her work is
    rooted in the lines created by nature, chartered, followed down
    trails, and carved through snow. Her sketchbooks continue to fill
    with the lines & messages throughout the landscapes &
    stories she explores.
  quote: |
    "Ever since I can imagine, I've needed to be outside -
    adventuring, sketching, getting lost in the surroundings around me
    and in my drawings. Creating is my way of fully submerging myself
    into my world. My art is inspired by the simple connection I hold
    with nature and the feeling I try to preserve with every painting
    or drawing. I feel most alive when I am out in the wilderness, and
    even more so when I create."

  bio: |
    Noelle is a watercolor and mixed media artist who brings
    fresh perspective into her landscape themes through creative
    texturing via embroidery and abstract detail atop realistic
    subjects. For the past decade, Noelle has been painting across the
    American West and currently lives in Denver, CO. As an
    environmental scientist by trade, she brings her left-brain
    attention to detail and discipline into her artwork, allowing the
    same topics that drive her professional work to seep into her art
    to inspire people to respect and wonder at natural
    resources.
  quote: |
    "I feel that humans have been moving farther away from
    their wild roots. Through my artwork, I try to bring outdoor
    inspiration and awe into a viewer’s daily life. While acknowledging
    the impossibility of re-creating the intricate beauty of the
    natural world, I am drawn to add abstraction to my watercolor
    pieces through alternative mediums such as embroidery - allowing
    the viewer to join me in an exploration of nature’s treasures. My
    favorite themes are abstract mountain and desertscapes- places that
    have always drawn me peacefully away from the hustle of human life
    and back to tranquil balance."

    "I love using color to help tell a story and nature has
    the most beautiful palette.  Most of my work involves people
    living life outside, in particular the strength of women in tandem
    with the power and beauty of the great outdoors."
