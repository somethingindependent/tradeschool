---

### With [Something Independent OutPost](http://www.somethingindependent.com/the-si-outpost/), [Rapidgrass Bluegrass Festival](http://rapidgrassfestival.com/), [Argo Gold Mine and Mill](http://historicargotours.com/) 

In this discussion, we will take a deeper dive into a community with a rural-makeup, getting to know more about the opportunities and sense of optimism of the community through the creative and committed people and projects at the forefront of a transitioning Idaho Springs. We will feature two projects and their visionary founders – The Argo redevelopment and Clear Creek RapidGrass Bluegrass Festival. This discussion is an outgrowth of the S:I OutPost, an initiative piloted in 2017 that spent time in Idaho Springs, and a few other rural communities on both the eastern plains and the west slope. The panel discussion will be followed by a short acoustic set from Mark and Sarah Morris, which is not-to-be-missed.
