### With [National Ski Patrol](https://www.nsp.org/)

The work we choose: explore the depths of the infectious pride, community and teamwork of the National Ski Patrol. When choosing to become a patroller, one chooses an identity that stands the test of time.  Once a patroller, always a patroller...  With that choice comes constant learning, responsibility, and the opportunity to engage in incredibly meaningful work. There is also an intimacy level that patrollers have with the mountains, ski areas/resorts and their communities that few share and enjoy. How can that unique level intimacy translate into a voice for real issues in our communities? Can we bottle up patroller pride into other fields?  How are ski patrol ingredients part of the changing recipe in our outdoor experiences?
