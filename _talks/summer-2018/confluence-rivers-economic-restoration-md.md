### The Confluence of Rivers & Economic Restoration

Rivers are the lifeblood of the west and communities have gathered around them throughout history. While these rivers ebb and flow, they remain constant, while the communities around them change and evolve. This session delves into the influence the river has on communities and its importance to economic vitality. Rivers can be an underutilized resource, but these panelists will discuss how they are working to transform the river into a tool to achieve the community's vision.
