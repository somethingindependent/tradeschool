Tracy Ross is a multiple-award-winning journalist, editor, and essayist whose work has appeared in the Best American Writing series three times and who won the coveted National Magazine Award (the Academy Awards of magazine writing) for a Backpacker essay she wrote called The Source of All Things, which later became a critically lauded memoir of the same name. These days, Ross writes for everyone from Outside to Prevention to Red Bulletin to The Hollywood Reporter and is working on a new book, based on a Backpacker story, Gone Girl, about the disappearance of a young Colorado woman in Nepal. Rossâ€™s assignments have taken her to the wilds of Alaska, the ski slopes of Iran, the steeps of Chamonix, and many points in between. She writes about exotic places and intriguing people, but mainly about the wilderness and how it intersects with the most important issues in our lives. And though she doesn't focus exclusively on the West in her writing, it has dramatically impacted her life since she was a child growing up in southern Idaho.
