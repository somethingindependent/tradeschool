Looking to network at the end of the trade show on Tuesday? Come join us at the Massive Impact Healthy Happy Hour. Free to the public and open to all, this event serves as a space to network and connect without alcohol present. Whether sober, sober supportive, sober curious, or just looking to meet new people, we'd love to see you there.

The event is free to attend, but you'll be able to purchase a drink or a hat with all proceeds going to support [The Phoenix](https://www.facebook.com/thephoenixnational/). 

Hosted by [Safety Third Podcast](https://www.facebook.com/safetythirdpodcast/) with host [Paddy O'Connell](https://www.facebook.com/paddy.oconnell.986)! Presented by [Farm to Feet](https://www.facebook.com/FarmtoFeet/) and powered by [Brew Dr. Kombucha](https://www.facebook.com/brewdrkombucha/) and [Kate's Real Food](https://www.facebook.com/KatesRealFood/).
