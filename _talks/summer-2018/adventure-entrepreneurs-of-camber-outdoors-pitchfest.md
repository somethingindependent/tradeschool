### Adventure Entrepreneurs of Camber Outdoor’s Pitchfest

This session brings four of the finalists from Camber Outdoor’s annual Pitchfest together to talk about what it takes to not only be innovative and creative as an entrepreneur in the world of adventure in a rapidly growing outdoor industry, but the grit and fortitude to persevere and get right back up in the face of adversity. It’s about the blood, sweat, and tears and the good, bad, and ugly in the name of adventure..
