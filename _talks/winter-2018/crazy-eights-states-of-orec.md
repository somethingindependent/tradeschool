title: 'Crazy 8s: The State(s) of Outdoor Recreation'
---

### With CO, MT, NC, OR, UT, VT, WA, and WY

Outdoor recreation has undergone a dramatic transformation from an undervalued industry into a powerhouse with $887 billion of economic impact and the political force to revitalize community, reshape economies, affect legislative issues and enact cultural change on a grand scale. At the vanguard of this movement is a set of leaders who do not resemble what anyone might expect from government official. They are hard-working and relatable, and put their heads down and go to work every day, hoping to leave things in a better place when their work is done. And when the work is done, they like to get outdoors, play, and swap a few good stories. Join us for a candid discussion with the heads of the 8 state outdoor recreation offices, and get a firsthand look into the dynamics of some of the least-typical government agencies around.
