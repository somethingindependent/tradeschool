### With [Next 100 Coalition](http://next100coalition.org/)

It is imperative that we create an inclusive outdoor industry that is open to all types of people and reflective of all communities regardless of the color of skin or gender. Outdoor recreation and conservation organizations should learn how to integrate diversity, equity, and inclusion into their vision and mission to have a long-term impact. This 90-minute workshop will introduce the Next 100 Coalition, whose mission is to establish a just and inclusive national parks and public lands system, and provide a framework to support organizations and companies in exploring and understanding equity and inclusion. The workshop will provide tools that organizations can use today, tomorrow, and longer term to establish a foundation for an inclusive culture. While the Next 100 Coalition is primarily focused on racial and ethnic diversity, this workshop will also present on the intersections of other marginalized identities.

### Speakers
