title: "Shifting Tides: Art + Industry + Advocacy"
---

### With [Colorado Business Committee for the Arts](http://cbca.org/) and Trade School artists

What business does art have in industry and advocacy? How can they all work together to raise awareness for each other? When does it make sense to incorporate artists in the mission? How do you make sure it's authentic? 

Join this panel featuring our Trade School artists, Jack Ludlum, John Fellows and Sarah Uhl. Weâ€™ll explore how this works.
